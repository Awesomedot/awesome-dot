### What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is a decentralized built to connect and secure unique blockchains, whether they be public, permission-less networks, private consortium chains, or oracles and other Web3 technologies. It enables an internet where independent blockchains can exchange information under common security guarantees.

### Motivation

As we look around, the Polkadot ecosystem has been growing at an exponential rate and catching up to the new platforms coming up seemed like an impossible task. To tackle this we created this tool that curates everything around the ecosystem, from dapps to learning resources.

### How to Contribute

We created this tool as a open source project to make sure its the most extensive resource of all things Polkadot related. You can contribute to project by creating a pull request to [this](https://github.com/Awesomedot/awesome-dot) repository. When you've completed your changes, you can add any specific details on what was changed and commit to a new branch to create a new Pull Request to the repository. From there one of the maintainers will review your changes, and either merge them or request changes.
